# Misc shared SageMath notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nthiery/shared-sage-notebooks/master)

I use this repository to publicly share some of my [SageMath](http://sagemath.org) documents, typically in the form of [http://jupyter.org](Jupyter) notebooks. This typically includes logbooks of quick demos or experimentations I wrote during a brainstorm with colleagues, and want to share thereafter.
Thanks to [Binder](http://binder.org), they can then access and play
with the notebook even if they do not have SageMath installed. Click
on the above Binder badge to try.

There is no guarantee whatsoever on the quality of any document here!
