# My shared SageMath notebooks

I use this repository to publicly share some of my [SageMath](http://sagemath.org) documents, typically in the form of [http://jupyter.org](Jupyter) notebooks. This typically includes logbooks of quick demos or experimentations I wrote during a brainstorm with colleagues, and want to share thereafter.
Thanks to [Binder](http://binder.org), they can then access and play with the notebook even if they do not have SageMath installed.
There is no guarantee whatsoever on the quality of any document here!
