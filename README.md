# Misc shared SageMath notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nthiery/shared-sage-notebooks/master)

In this repository I publicly share some [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org) documents,
usually as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks, typically containing quick demos or
experimentations written during a brainstorm with colleagues.

Thanks to [Binder](https://mybinder.org), one can access these documents and play with them
without needing to install SageMath. Click on the above Binder badge to try.

You may also quickly browse the documents locally with the following instructions:

1.  If you haven't it yet, install `uv` (fast package management based on pip):
    [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

2.  Run JupyterLab; the required software will be automatically
    installed in the subdirectory .venv:
     ```
     uv run jupyter lab
     ```

    To actually run the examples, you need to have sagemath installed.

There is no guarantee whatsoever on the quality of any document here!
