# Misc shared SageMath notebooks

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nthiery/shared-sage-notebooks/master)

In this repository I publicly share some [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org) documents,
usually as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks, typically containing quick demos or
experimentations written during a brainstorm with colleagues.

Thanks to [Binder](https://mybinder.org), one can access these documents and play with them
without needing to install SageMath. Click on the above Binder badge to try.

There is no guarantee whatsoever on the quality of any document here!
